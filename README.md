## Project Description

This project simulates an audio amplifier using MicroCap12.Requirements are as follows : 

Design an audio amplifier. It must contain a voltage amplification stage and an AB output stage. Implement the amplification stage using transistors or op-amps, with freedom of choice. Implement the AB output stage using transistors. The transistor can be bipolar or MOSFET. Select all components and explain their choice, show the calculation of critical components. Calculate the maximum efficiency coefficient. Perform circuit simulation in Microcap. Use DC analysis to check the quiescent currents of the amplifier. Use transient simulations to verify the circuit's operation, find the maximum input voltage, and measure the circuit gain in the linear regime. Use AC analysis to check the bandwidth of the amplifier. The speaker parameters are resistance R = 8Î© and power P = 40W.

Note:Detailed documentation is also in the repository if you wish to know how to calculate parameters of each sub-block.In the following sections there will only be brief description of each sub-block with general formulas.
